# What is Gamblecore? ðŸŽ°
Currently when I made this repository, Gamblecore is known for *gambling* and for being so *competetive* at my school. Gamblecore is a big and significant project for me since all the people liked it and it was very easy to undersrtand. It was on a very famouse google doc at my school called *Project Existenceâ„¢* which is where Gamblecore was.

# More about Project Existenceâ„¢ ðŸ‘€
Project Existenceâ„¢ general porpuse is to play games on your computer from school and create a community, trying to inculde everyone. Project Existenceâ„¢ was a Google Doc created by my best friend, Justin, shared and used by around 300 students at my school. 
Of course, not all of it was about games, there was also Videos, Music, Art, Merch, and inculding Gambling (Gamblecore.)
